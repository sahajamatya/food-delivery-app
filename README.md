# food-delivery-app

This is a food delivery app I made with React to demonstrate my understanding and use of the following React concepts. Note, this app serves to showcase basic utlity abilities rather than a design or aesthetic in the UI: 

* Functional Components 
* State Management 
* Conditional Rendering 
* Styling React Components
* Context API 
* React Hooks 
    * useState
    * useReducer
    * useEffect
    * useContext
    * useRef
    * useImperativeHandle

This app is built in parallel with the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/" target="_blank">React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)</a>
facilitated by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Build in progress, view live at:
