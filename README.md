# Food Delivery App

This is a food delivery app I made with React to demonstrate my understanding and use of the following React concepts. The data is fetched from the backend which is plugged into a Firebase Real Time Database. Note, this app serves to showcase programmed functional UI abilities rather than UI design and aesthetic:

- Functional Components
- State Management
- Conditional Rendering
- Styling React Components
- Context API
- React Hooks
  - useState
  - useReducer
  - useEffect
  - useContext
  - useRef
  - useImperativeHandle
- Http Requests
- Form Validation Handling

This app is built in parallel with the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/" target="_blank">React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)</a>
facilitated by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller.
